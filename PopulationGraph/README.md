Population Graph
================================================
Hover the mouse on the year to check the top 10 countries with the largest populations then. Press the mouse to obtain the detailed number of the populations. The area of the circle is positively correlated to the populations.

First I have to say that when I started coding I was completely unsure if I could make it. And the final graph appeared even better than my expectation and imagination. 

Two groups of data are used to create this graph, including the location and the population of the top 10 countries with the largest populations. I obtained the location of countries on the global map manually since there was no better way. The population data was from the website of the US Census Bureau. 

Several problems remain unsolved in this sketch. First I cannot establish a function to adjust the font size properly with the size of the canvas. Secondly it is annoying to figure out the location of countries manually.
