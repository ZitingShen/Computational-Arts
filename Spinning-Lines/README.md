Spinning-Lines
=========================
These patterns are made by spinning the outmost segments of three-segment zigzags. Some linesâ€™ lengths, spinning angles and colors are determined by noises.

When doing the project, first I span a two-segment zigzag, and then changed it to a three-segment one. In order to make the patterns look beautiful, it took me a lot of time to experiment which variables should change at deterministic rates or at non-deterministic rates with the noise function. I chose to only show the outmost segment of the zigzags to make the patterns more aesthetic. However, I was not satisfied only show one pattern at a time, thus I learned from processing.org how to use a float list to store many variables and create many patterns at a time.

The program could still be improved because I used too many global variables. If I show patterns in a 5*4 grid, the programs will get a little stuck. However, I still kept the float list global because I wanted to keep some lengths and spinning angles created and changed by random or noise functions. I have not come with ideas to solve this dilemma.
